# Technology Stack

My portfolio website’s tech stack is a powerful combination of React, Bootstrap, and CSS. Let’s break it down:
  - **React**: As the heart of this application, React provides a dynamic and efficient user interface. It allows you to build reusable components, manage state, and handle interactions seamlessly. 
  - **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap offers a plethora of pre-designed components, responsive grids, and utility classes. It simplifies layout creation, enhances consistency, and ensures that the website looks great across various devices.
  - **CSS**: Custom styling using CSS gives the portfolio a unique visual identity by tweaking bootstrap components.
